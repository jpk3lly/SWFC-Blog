            <h2>New Ownership - What's The Plan?</h2>
            <aside>By JP Kelly</aside>
            <p>He's Gone!! We've finally seen the back of Dejphon Chansiri, and there's lots of buzz around the potential new owners with people speculating on interested parties from the US including billionaires such as Tilman Ferttita and the Walton Penner family. Regardless of who takes the club out of administration, one thing is certain. They need to have a plan on how to run a financially stable football team. Detailed below are the areas I think any new owner needs to concentrate on. Some people may not agree with me, but I personally think whoever the new owners are, they need to stick the idea of success and the Premier League on the back burner for a while, you can't build without good foundations and that takes time more than money.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Facilities</h3>
            <p>There's a big debate going on between fans on social media at the minute as to whether it's better to stay at Hillsborough or move to a new purpose built stadium. I think there's valid arguments on both sides to this one, Hillsborough is historic, iconic and when it's bouncing there's not many to rival it. That being said, the old girl is tired having been left to rack and ruin by Mr Chansiri. The fact that the North Stand lost it's safety certificate at the beginning of this season, in my opinion is criminal. Fan safety should be paramount for any football club owner, but for the owner of a club whose ground has tragic history attached to it maintenence and safety should be so high up the priority list it makes your head spin. I would like to see us stay at Hillsborough, but there needs to be some serious money spent on bringing it up to standard, similarly Middlewood Road requires a fair bit of investment.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Youth Set Up</h3>
            <p>The youth set up might be the most important part of a club, it's your future. I know lots of people were upset when Man City swooped in for Caelan Cadamarteri at the start of the year, but I think that's partly what the youth set up should be about. We should be focusing on consistently producing the stars of tomorrow, hopefully those young players will stay on and be superstars for the owls, but if we fall on hard times or they want to move elsewhere we can get decent transfer fees for them.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Ego & Honesty</h3>
            <p>I think this was Mr Chansiri's biggest problem, his arrogance. In business the most successfull people are the ones who can admit their weaknesses and address them by building a strong team around them with knowledge in areas they might be lacking in. Whoever comes in, needs to adopt this approach. The club needs people involved in the day to day running of the club, who know how to do it and it's not a failure for an owner to admit it's not them and hire people in. One of Chansiri's earliest errors was sacking Glen Roeder as director of football and that is a mistake we desperatley don't want to make again.</p>
            <br>
            <p>These are the things I think the new owners need to priorise before starting to set targets like, Premier League 2028 etc. Even if that means a few seasons down in League 1 rebuilding, it will be worth it in the long run. I also hope that the give Henrik Pederson the chance to stay on a make a go of it, with a budget to actually build a squad and have a full team of backroom staff, again one of my early peeves with Chansiri was the fact he sacked Stuary Grey when he'd done an exelent job with what he had.</p>
